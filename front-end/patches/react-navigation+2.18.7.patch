+## The issue tracker is reserved for bug reports only.
+
+If you have a question, feature request, or an idea for improving the library or its related tools, please try one of the following resources:
+
+- [Read the documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
+- [Post an issue to the website repository if you'd like to see a documentation change](http://github.com/react-navigation/website)
+- [Post a feature request to Canny](https://react-navigation.canny.io/feature-requests)
+- [Write a RFC if you have ideas for how to implement a feature request](https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs)
+- [Get help on Discord chat (#react-navigation on Reactiflux)](https://discord.gg/4xEK3nD) or [on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-navigation)
+- Search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch. However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version, you should open a new issue.
+
+Bugs with react-navigation must be reproducible *without any external libraries that operate on it*. This means that if you are attempting to use Redux or MobX with it and you think you have found a bug, you must be able to reproduce it without Redux or MobX in this report. Redux related issues belong in [react-navigation-redux-helpers](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation-redux-helpers), and we do not have any first-class integration with MobX at the moment.
+

+
+### Current Behavior
+
+- What code are you running and what is happening?
+- Include a screenshot if it makes sense.
+
+### Expected Behavior
+
+- What do you expect should be happening?
+- Include a screenshot if it makes sense.
+
+### How to reproduce
+
+- You must provide a way to reproduce the problem. If you are having an issue with your machine or build tools, the issue belongs on another repository as that is outside of the scope of React Navigation.
+- Either re-create the bug on [Snack](https://snack.expo.io) or link to a GitHub repository with code that reproduces the bug.
+- Explain how to run the example app and any steps that we need to take to reproduce the issue from the example app.

+
+## [2.11.0] - [2018-08-03](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.11.0)

+- Android back button in stack with drawer closes drawer properly if open (react-navigation-drawer@0.5.0)
+- Fixes bug where `null` doesn't work in routerOptions `paths` object for deeplinking ([#4791](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/4791))
+
+## [2.9.3] - [2018-07-26](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.9.3)
+### Added
+- Add `NavigationTestUtils` which can be imported by path to be used with jest snapshot testing.
+
+## [2.9.2] - [2018-07-25](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.9.2)
+### Added
+- Export `StackViewTransitionConfigs` to allow you to extend default config in custom transition configs. [#4761](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/4761)
+
+### Fixed
+- Error when building with haul: ref to pathToRegexp.compile. [#4658](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/4658).
+
+## [2.9.1] - [2018-07-24](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.9.1)
+### Fixed
+- Incorrect parameters passed to title offset calculation led to bug in header layout when no right component (https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/4754)
+
+### Fixed
+- Typo in Header transition preset check.
+
+## [2.9.0] - [2018-07-20](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.9.0)
+### Added
+- `headerLayoutPreset: 'center' | 'left'` to provide an easy solution for [questions like this](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/4615).
+- `headerBackTitleEnabled` - this configuration option for stack navigator allows you to force back button titles to either be rendered or not (if you disagree with defaults for your platform and layout preset).
+
+### Fixed
+- Android back button ripple is now appropriately sized (fixes [#3955](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/3955)).
+- Respect header background color on container (fixes edge case where user depended on displaying content that was rendered behind the navigator, this particular behavior should not be depended on and may break in the future, but this change is still useful regardless).
+
+
+## [2.8.0] - [2018-07-19](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.8.0)
+### Added
+- `headerLeftContainerStyle`, `headerTitleContainerStyle`, and `headerRightContainerStyle` are exposed on `navigationOptions`. These properties allow you to customize the style of the container of `headerLeft`, `headerTitle` and `headerRight` components.
+
+### Fixed
+- Fixed memory leaks in `createNavigator`: [closure scope leak](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/1a765562905e93bbae0262dd20c2688221c999e8), and [clean up old descriptors](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/93642e16e7ff029586b68ee732ec790504ee4862).
+
+## [2.7.0] - [2018-07-17](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.7.0)
+### Added
+- The enableURLHandling prop on the top level navigator component allows you to disable deep linking handling. Currently it is always enabled. To disable it, `<RootNavigator enableURLHandling={false} />`
+
+### Changed
+- StackNavigator.replace method no longer requires a key param. If the key is left undefined, the last screen in the stack will be replaced.
+
+### Fixed
+- Support headerLeft component for the first screen in a stack (#4608).
+- Removed bottomBorder when `headerTransparent` is set to true.
+- Improve empty path and param handling in deep linking (#4671). This fixes issues with deep linking and fully tests the differences between path: '' and path: null. Empty string matches empty paths, and null path will let the child router handle paths at the same level. Also it makes sure that params are not duplicated between path and query when they are serialized with getPathAndParamsForState.
+- Fix onTransitionStart not being invoked when provided in navigator config.(#4100)
+- Rare case when users navigated back and forth quickly with exactly the right timing would cause a crash due to a scene being queued to transition, then clobbered, then attempted to render as a stale scene but without a descriptor. ([commit](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/cab4d71a5e09188df3f4a294c98779eecb860a78))
+
+## [2.6.2] - [2018-07-06](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.6.2)
+### Changed
+- Relax vertical padding warnings on header.
+
+## [2.6.1] - [2018-07-05](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.6.1)
+### Added
+- Warn for more invalid headerStyle properties (padding, top/right/bottom/left, position).
+
+### Fixed
+- Fixed missing header shadow on Android.
+
+## [2.6.0] - [2018-07-04](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.6.0)
+### Added
+- [NavigationEvents](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/4188) component as a declarative interface for subscribing to navigation focus events.
+
+### Fixed
+- Fix stack router child router delegation priority (https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/e8c1833053e37d28f0ce505ff323565abf23b6a2)
+- Avoid crash when calling isFocused on old route (https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/0921889f7a3acfc6d6bcc4909d209eeeee985ba7)
+- Stack router no longer attempts to parse query params within path handling
+- Switch router now has exact same param treatment for URLs as stack router does
+
+### Changed
+- Internally we no longer need to special case PlatformHelpers by platform as react-native-web handles the APIs we mocked out with it now.
+
+## [2.5.5] - [2018-06-27](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.5.5)
+### Added
+- Throw error in development mode when header navigation option is set to a string - a common mistake that would otherwise result in a cryptic error message.
+- Throw error in development mode when title is not a string.
+
+### Fixed
+- Delegate to child routers for more than just the top screen in the stack.
+- Update react-navigation-drawer to 0.4.3 to fix `initialRouteParams` option
+
+## [2.5.4] - [2018-06-27](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.5.4)
+### Fixed
+- Header no longer sometimes flashes for 1 frame when using `header: null` on initial route of stack with floating header.
+- Export `createSwitchNavigator` in react-navigation.web.js
+
+## [2.5.3] - [2018-06-23](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.5.3)

+# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
+
+## Our Pledge
+
+In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
+
+## Our Standards
+
+Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
+
+* Using welcoming and inclusive language
+* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
+* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
+* Focusing on what is best for the community
+* Showing empathy towards other community members
+
+Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
+
+* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
+* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
+* Public or private harassment
+* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
+* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
+
+## Our Responsibilities
+
+Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
+
+Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
+
+## Scope
+
+This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
+
+## Enforcement
+
+Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at adam@expo.io. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
+
+Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
+
+## Attribution
+
+This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]

+# Contributing to React Navigation
+
+This library is a community effort: it can only be great if we all help out in one way or another! If you feel like you aren't experienced enough using React Navigation to contribute, you can still make an impact by:
+
+* Responding to one of the open [issues](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues). Even if you can't resolve or fully answer a question, asking for more information or clarity on an issue is extremely beneficial for someone to come after you to resolve the issue.
+* Creating public example repositories or [Snacks](https://snack.expo.io/) of navigation problems you have solved and sharing the links in [Community Resources](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/blob/master/COMMUNITY_RESOURCES.md).
+* Answering questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=react-navigation).
+* Answering questions in our [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com/) channel.
+* Providing feedback on the open [PRs](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pulls).
+* Providing feedback on the open [RFCs](https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs).
+* Improving the [website](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation.github.io).
+
+If you would like to submit a pull request, please follow the [Contributors guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/contributing.html) to find out how. If you don't know where to start, check the ones with the label [`good first issue`](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/labels/good%20first%20issue) - even [fixing a typo in the documentation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/pull/2727) is a worthy contribution!
